# Landing page

This landing page project is a demonstration of the things I've learned related to HTML and CSS in the Foundations Course of The Odin Project curriculum.

The design and theme of the web page is inspired by the design provided in the Assignment section, with some changes that suit better for my project's theme, which is musical instruments.
